    Instructions to how to use the calculator:
    
1)  It works as a normal calculator, however only basic operations are present in it.
2)  2 Instructions are already written on the website that you can see.
3)  Apart from that you can use your keyboard or keys present on the screen for the desired output.
4)  It takes a single input at a time that it displays on the screen, then takes an operator, then the second input and finally displays the output by hitting 'Enter' or '=' button on      the keyboard and screen respectively.
5)  For deleting the input if entered wrong you can use 'Delete' or 'Backspace' button to delete the last digit.
6)  For multiple inputs follow step 4) then instead of hitting 'Enter' click the next operator and then the second input, the first input will be now the output of the previous two         inputs, So in that way a user can enter any number of inputs however the user must follow the BODMAS property correctly to obtain the correct output.
